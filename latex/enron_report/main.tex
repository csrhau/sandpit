\begin{abstract}
  This document describes several basic communication patterns found in the Enron dataset.
  Students should be able to reproduce at least some of these results using their software.
\end{abstract}

\section{Message Rates}
The events of the Enron scandal clearly impacted the rates at which e-mails were sent within the firm.
Students were asked to plot message rates for both the whole firm and individual users.

\section{Alias Detection}
Many Enron employees had multiple e-mail addresses, both professional and personal.
There are several approaches to detecting aliases in the data. 
These range from simple fuzzy-matching of e-mail addresses to advanced techniques like authorship identification via text mining or node similarity metrics based on graph structure.
The aliases given in AUTOREF were generated with the former simplistic approach.
