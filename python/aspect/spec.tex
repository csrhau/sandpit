Coding Test


Write an application to detect outlier data points in the attached CSV file.
You may implement the code in Java, C++, Python or MATLAB.
The application should read the CSV file in, inform the user of the outliers found, and then write out a clean version of the data with the outlier points removed.
 
When analysing each point the outlier algorithm should only use historical (previous) data. 
It is not allowed to see into the future. The algorithm should not be complex and can be heuristic.
When considering the structure of the code think of supporting alternative algorithms and data sources such as a database or remote process.
You only need to implement a single algorithm.
