This is the solution to the lights problem posed by G. Cormode:

Alice enters a room, inside which there are 64 lightbulbs connected to 64 switches.
The lightbulbs can be either on or off and each lightbulb's initial state is random.

On entering the room, Alice is given a number in the range [1-64] and allowed to flip at most one switch.
She must then leave the room, before Bob enters, with no communication between the two.
Bob must then state which number Alice was given.

The pair are allowed no communication during the test, but are allowed to come up with a plan before it.
